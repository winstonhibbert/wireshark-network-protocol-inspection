# Wireshark Network Protocol Inspection

**Category:** Network Security & Threat Analysis  

---

## 🛠️ Scenario Overview
This project involves inspecting various network protocols using Wireshark. The setup includes a **Windows VM** and a **Linux VM** running on Azure. The network traffic between these machines is captured and analyzed to observe protocol behaviors and security implications.

### 🔍 **Hypothesis**
- Analyzing network traffic with Wireshark will reveal insights into various communication protocols.
- Applying filters will allow targeted inspection of traffic, including ICMP, SSH, HTTP, DNS, and RDP.
- Firewall rules can be modified to control network behavior effectively.

## 🛡️ Blocking and Allowing Traffic

### 📝 **Firewall Rule Implementation**

#### 🔹 **Blocking ICMP Traffic**
- **Created firewall rules** on Azure to block ICMP traffic to the Linux VM.
